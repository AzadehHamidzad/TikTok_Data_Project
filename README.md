## **Google Advanced Data Analytics – TikTok Project**

### **Project Title:**  
**Classifying TikTok Videos Using Machine Learning**

### **Overview**  
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify TikTok videos as either presenting a **claim** or an **opinion**, in an effort to address **misinformation** on social media platforms. This project was completed as part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics** professional certificate.

---

### **Objectives**  
- Develop a classification model for short-form videos.
- Understand and address ethical considerations in using machine learning for content moderation.
- Improve the reliability of information consumed on platforms like TikTok.

---

### **Project Structure**

**Part 1: Ethical Considerations**
- Assessed the ethical implications of using machine learning for video classification.
- Evaluated whether the model objective should be redefined to align with ethical standards.

**Part 2: Feature Engineering**
- Performed feature selection, extraction, and transformation.
- Prepared the dataset for machine learning modeling.

**Part 3: Modeling**
- Built, evaluated, and compared different machine learning models.
- Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and ethical impact.

---

### **Tools & Technologies**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Advanced Data Analytics curriculum

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- Machine learning can assist in identifying content types (claim vs. opinion) on social media platforms.
- Ethical modeling requires careful definition of objectives and data handling.
- Feature engineering plays a crucial role in building effective models.
